[Nebula](https://github.com/nebulaclouds/nebula) is an open-source, Kubernetes-native
workflow orchestrator implemented in [Go](https://go.dev/). It enables highly
concurrent, scalable and reproducible workflows for data processing, machine
learning and analytics.

Created at [Lyft](https://www.lyft.com/) in collaboration with Spotify,
Freenome, and many others, Nebula provides first-class support for
{doc}`Python <reference_nebulakit>`,
[Java, and Scala](https://github.com/nebulaclouds/nebulakit-java). Data Scientists
and ML Engineers in the industry use Nebula to create:

- Data pipelines for processing petabyte-scale data.
- Analytics workflows for business and finance use cases.
- Machine learning pipelines for logistics, image processing, and cancer diagnostics.
