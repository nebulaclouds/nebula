# User Guide

If this is your first time using Nebula, check out the {doc}`Getting Started <index>` guide.

This *User Guide*, the {doc}`Tutorials <tutorials>`, and the {doc}`Integrations <integrations>` examples cover all of
the key features of Nebula for data analytics, data science and machine learning practitioners, organized by topic. Each
section below introduces a core feature of Nebula and how you can use it to address specific use cases. Code for all
of the examples can be found in the [nebulasnacks repo](https://github.com/nebulaclouds/nebulasnacks).

It comes with a specific environment to make running, documenting
and contributing samples easy. If this is your first time running these examples, follow the
{doc}`environment setup guide <nebulasnacks/environment_setup>` to get started.

```{tip}
To learn about how to spin up and manage a Nebula cluster in the cloud, see the
{doc}`Deployment Guides <deployment/index>`.
