Migrating Your Authentication Config
####################################

.. tags:: Authentication, Infrastructure, Advanced

Nebula previously shipped with only a barebones OIDC setup, and relied on an external authorization server. This
migration guide helps you move to Admin's own authorization server.

Okta Config changes
===================

Using Okta as an example, you would have previously seen something like the following:

* An Application (OpenID Connect Web) for NebulaAdmin itself (e.g. **0oal5rch46pVhCGF45d6**).
* An Application (OpenID Native app) for Nebula-cli/NebulaCTL (e.g. **0oal62nxuD6OSFSRq5d6**).
  These two applications would be assigned to the relevant users.
* An Application (Web) for NebulaPropeller (e.g. **0abc5rch46pVhCGF9876**).
  This application would either use the default Authorization server, or you would create a new one.

Admin Config Changes
====================

After Nebula version `0.13.0 <https://github.com/nebulaclouds/nebula/tree/v0.13.0>`__,
you can still use the IdP as the Authorization Server if you wish.

              appAuth:
                  # External delegates app auth responsibilities to an external authorization server, Internal means NebulaAdmin does it itself
                  authServerType: External
                  thirdPartyConfig:
                      nebulaClient:
                          clientId: 0oal62nxuD6OSFSRq5d6

                          - all
                          - offline

To summarize the changes between pre-``v0.13.0`` and post-``v0.13.0``:

* The original **oauth** section has been moved two levels higher into its own section and renamed **auth** but enabling/disabling of authentication remains in the old location.
* Secrets by default will now be looked up in **/etc/secrets**. Use the following command to generate them:

  .. prompt:: bash $

     nebulaadmin secrets init -p /etc/secrets

  This will generate the new cookie hash/block keys, as well as other secrets Admin needs to run the Authorization server.

* The **clientSecretFile** has been moved to **/etc/secrets/oidc_client_secret** so move that there.
* **claims** has been removed, just delete that.
* **authorizeUrl** and **tokenUrl** are no longer necessary.
* The **baseUrl** for the external Authorization Server is now in the **appAuth** section.
* The **thirdPartyConfig** has been moved to **appAuth** as well.
* **redirectUrl** has been defaulted to **/console**. If that's the value you want, then you no longer need this setting.

Propeller Config Changes
========================

Similarly, there are NebulaPropeller config changes to be aware of.

.. tabs::

   .. group-tab:: < v0.13.0

      .. code-block:: yaml
      
          admin:
            endpoint: dns:///mycompany.domain.com
            useAuth: true
            clientId: nebulapropeller
            clientSecretLocation: /etc/secrets/client_secret
            tokenUrl: https://demo.nuclyde.io/oauth2/token
            scopes:
            - all

   .. group-tab:: >= v0.13.0

      .. code-block:: yaml
      
          admin:
            endpoint: dns:///mycompany.domain.com
            # If you are using the built-in authorization server, you can delete the following two lines:
            clientId: nebulapropeller
            clientSecretLocation: /etc/secrets/client_secret

To summarize the changes between pre-``v0.13.0`` and post-``v0.13.0``:

* **useAuth** is deprecated and will be removed in a future version. Auth requirement will be discovered through an anonymous admin discovery call.
* **tokenUrl** and **scopes** will also be discovered through a metadata call.
* **clientId** and **clientSecretLocation** have defaults that work out of the box with the built-in authorization server (e.g. if you setup Google OpenID Connect).
