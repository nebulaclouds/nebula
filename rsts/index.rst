`Nebula Tags <_tags/tagsindex.html>`__

`Nebula <https://github.com/nebulaclouds/nebula>`__ is an open-source, Kubernetes-native
workflow orchestrator implemented in `Go <https://go.dev/>`__. It enables highly
concurrent, scalable and reproducible workflows for data processing, machine
learning and analytics.

Created at `Lyft <https://www.lyft.com/>`__ in collaboration with Spotify,
Freenome, and many others, Nebula provides first-class support for
`Python <https://docs.nebula.org/projects/nebulakit/en/latest/>`__,
`Java, and Scala <https://github.com/nebulaclouds/nebulakit-java>`__. Data Scientists
and ML Engineers in the industry use Nebula to create:

- ETL pipelines for petabyte-scale data processing.
- Analytics workflows for business and finance use cases.
- Machine learning pipelines for logistics, image processing, and cancer diagnostics.
