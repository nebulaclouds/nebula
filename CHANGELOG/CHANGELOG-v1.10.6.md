# Nebula 1.10.6 Release

Due to a mishap in the move to the monorepo, we ended up generating the git tags between 1.10.1 to 1.10.5, so in order to decrease the confusion we decided to skip those patch versions and go straight to the next available version.

We've shipped a ton of stuff in this patch release, here are some of the highlights.

## GPU Accelerators
You'll be able to get more fine-grained in the use GPU Accelerators in your tasks. Here are some examples:

No preference of GPU accelerator to use:
```
@task(limits=Resources(gpu="1"))
def my_task() -> None:
    ...
```

Schedule on a specific GPU accelerator:
```
from nebulakit.extras.accelerators import T4


@task(
    limits=Resources(gpu="1"),
    accelerator=T4,
)
def my_task() -> None:
    ...
```

Schedule on a Multi-instance GPU (MIG) accelerator with no preference of partition size:
```
from nebulakit.extras.accelerators import A100


@task(
    limits=Resources(gpu="1"),
    accelerator=A100,
)
def my_task() -> None:
    ...
```

Schedule on a Multi-instance GPU (MIG) accelerator with a specific partition size:
```
from nebulakit.extras.accelerators import A100


@task(
    limits=Resources(gpu="1"),
    accelerator=A100.partition_1g_5gb,
)
def my_task() -> None:
    ...
```

Schedule on an unpartitioned Multi-instance GPU (MIG) accelerator:
```
from nebulakit.extras.accelerators import A100


@task(
    limits=Resources(gpu="1"),
    accelerator=A100.unpartitioned,
)
def my_task() -> None:
    ...
```

## Improved support for Ray logs
https://github.com/nebulaclouds/nebula/pull/4266 opens the door for RayJob logs to be persisted.

In https://github.com/nebulaclouds/nebula/pull/4397 we added support for a link to a Ray dashboard to show up in the task card.

## Updated grafana dashboards
We updated the official grafana dashboards in https://github.com/nebulaclouds/nebula/pull/4382.

## Support for Azure AD
A new version of our stow fork added support for Azure AD in https://github.com/nebulaclouds/stow/pull/9.
