# Nebula Single cluster deployment mode
This allows nebula to be deployed in one Kubernetes cluster.
All components are deployed and can be configured to use dependencies based on the environment.

To understand configuration of dependencies refer to sandbox or any cloud deployments

Overlays using the single cluster mode
1. [Sandbox Overlay](../../overlays/sandbox)
1. [GCP SingleCluster Overlay](../../overlays/gcp)
1. [EKS SingleCluster Overlay](../../overlays/eks)

These overlays are based on [Nebula Single Cluster deployment Configuration base](./complete)

The complete per component configuration for Nebula can be found [here](./headless/config)
